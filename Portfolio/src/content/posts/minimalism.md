Why do we love terminal interfaces?
Because they strip away the "noise" of modern UI.

## The Cognitive Load

Every gradient, shadow, and animation currently fighting for your attention costs cognitive energy.
Terminal UIs (TUIs) respect the user's attention. Data is text. Action is command.

- **Speed**: No layout shift.
- **Clarity**: High contrast, monospaced predictability.
- **Power**: The keyboard is faster than the mouse.

Building a portfolio that mimics this isn't just an aesthetic choice; it's a statement about **efficiency**.
